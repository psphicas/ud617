Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce

## Final Project

Given a set of forum posts, use map-reduce to solve the following problems:

### Student Times
For each student, find the hour during which the student has posted the most posts.

- [mapper](student_times_mapper.py)
- [reducer](student_times_reducer.py)

### Post and Answer Length

For each question, find the length of the post and the average answer length.

- [mapper](average_length_mapper.py)
- [reducer](average_length_reducer.py)

### Top Tags

Find the Top 10 tags, ordered by the number of questions they appear in.

- [mapper](popular_tags_mapper.py)
- [reducer](popular_tags_reducer.py)

### Study Groups

For each forum thread (i.e. a question node with all its answers and comments),
list the students that have posted there.

- [mapper](study_groups_mapper.py)
- [reducer](study_groups_reducer.py)

## Datasets

Udacity provides two datasets compatible with the scripts:

- [small dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/student_test_posts.csv)
- [full dataset](http://content.udacity-data.com/course/hadoop/forum_data.tar.gz)

## Validation

Validation instructions are provided here:

https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud617/local-testing-instructions

Here is the output generated by the scripts when using the small dataset:

- [Student Times output](student_times.tsv)
- [Post and Answer Length output](answer_length.tsv)
- [Top Tags output](popular_tags.tsv)
- [Study Groups output](study_groups.tsv)
